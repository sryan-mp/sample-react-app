# Using the mParticle Events API in a React App
This demo shows how to use the [commerce tracking set-up](https://docs.mparticle.com/developers/sdk/web/commerce-tracking/) to send a ViewProduct object to the mParticle dashboard.  

## Get started
To use send data from this sample app to your mParticle dashboard, add your mPartice ID to the script tag in index.html. To demo the UI without sending data, remove this tag from index.html completely. 

After cloning this repo, run `npm start` to run the app on localhost:3000.
